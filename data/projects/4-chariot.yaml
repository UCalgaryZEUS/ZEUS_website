  This makeshift vehicle dubbed <i>"The Chariot"</i> was made to test the NovAtel equipment we received. It was used as a dummy to setup a Raspberry Pi and automate data collection when powered on. Eventually, we will have to retire The Chariot to mount the SPAN IGM A1 (a $36,000 accelerometer that records speed and acceleration down to the <i>nanosecond!</i>) on The Zephyr, our electric race bike.
