  Lovingly dubbed "The Mule" this motorcycle was Team Zeus' humble beginnings.  While far from a race-worthy bike, the aim here was to convert an existing gasoline motorcycle to electric using a budget of under $1000 and as little outside help as possible.  We managed to successfully pull it off, producing a fully functional electric motorcycle and learning a wealth of knowledge about how they work.
  <br><br>
  In the second phase of the project, we are upgrading the very underpowered Mule with a much more powerful motor that we are building from scratch.  Using a slightly modified blueprint from a detailed ebook, the "Axel Borg Motor" should theoritically allow the Mule to hit highway speeds.
  <br><br>
  As for future plans, the Mule will always remain as a project bike to tinker around on and for new generations of first years to learn on.
