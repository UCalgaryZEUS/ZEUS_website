  We started building the Zephyr in early 2013 with the purchase of our motorcycle frame. The Zephyr began life as a 2004 Suzuki GSX-R 600 
  which had a a fast and furious past as a gasoline powered racing bike with Calgary's Motorcycle Roadracing Association (CMRA).  We 
  removed all the gasoline components and were left with a lightweight aluminum frame, complete with race quality suspension.
